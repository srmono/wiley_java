*Shopping Management Java Console App:

***This app simulates the working of an online shopping portal 
- where customers can buy products. 
- purely console-based application 

Admin Panel – functions provided like managing products and customers
Customer Panel – functions provided like buying products and making payments

Shop.java ( This is the main or the starting point of the project )
Admin.java
Customer.java
Products.java
Cart.java
Payment.java
Bills.java

***Concepts to be Used:
String manipulations
Collections framework in form of ArrayList
Exception Handling
Inheritance 
Classes and Objects
BufferedReader for taking entry

Interface
Best way of organizing code


***Role Based Management:

**
Design class files – Store.java, Shop.java, Admin.java, and Customer.java 
Design class file – products.java 
Design class file – bills.java 
Design class files – Payment.java and Cart.java 


***DETAILS OF CLASS FILES:

MAIN CLASS ( superclass ) = Shop.java

SUBCLASSES of Shop.java = admin.java and customer.java

- Shop.java :

Main functions = registration of customer or admin, login into system Entry through buffered Reader
Array List used in login function to store id, password, and user type ( C for the customer, A for admin ) as a list

csv or text files used are login info, admin info, and cast info Login info = storing used id, password, and type of user Admininfo = storing all details of admin except password Custinfo = storing all details of the customer except password setUID() function sets the admin ID to store in (store) setCUID() function sets the customer ID to store in the files


- Admin.java 
Functions include managing products (add,delete,view,search) by calling productsPage() function of products.java

Other functions include adding customers, removing customers, editing profiles, view registered customers.

For registering customers, since admin.java is subclass of Shop.java , registerCustomer() function of Shop is called by Shop.registerCustomer(), hence the small use of inheritance is here as the function need not be rewritten.

- Customer.java :
Database table custinfo accessed for editing profile function

The main functions are viewing products, searching for products, adding and removing products from the cart, view the cart, and proceeding to the payment function.

Here first initializeProducts() function is called to store all product info in array lists, so that database need not be accessed everytime, hence Concept of collection framework is used here in form of ArrayList and through ArrayList functions .add(), .get(), .clear()

.add() = to add to ArrayList

.get(int i) = to get the element stored at index i in the ArrayList

Proceed to payment function calls payment.java class file and functions like add to cart, remove from the cart, and view cart call Cart.java. Calling is done via class objects like customerCart and p.

customerCart = object of Cart class p=object of Payment class

Customer.java is also the subclass of Shop.java where it calls the registerCustomer() function of the Shop.java through Classname.methodname like Shop.registerCustomer()

- Products.java :
The main functions are added, removing, altering product info, viewing, and searching products setPid() function is used to set product id to store in the database

database table products are accessed to add, remove and alter product info

- Cart.java :
This class file contains functions of the cart like add to cart, view cart, remove the product from the cart and cancel cart which is called from the customer.java class file via object.

Here add to cart function gets the product details to be added from customer.class via the constructor and adds them to the ArrayList so that the ArrayList can be used later on for displaying cart details and other functions as required.

- Payment.java :
The main function of the payment class is to display bills and pay bills by calling bill.java, therefore it is an intermediate class between customer.java and bill.java and this class also stores payment details like bill and card details.

- Bill.java :
Bill. class is called from the payment page through an object, this class contains details of a bill like a billing id, products purchased, and total amount. It also contains customer details whose bill it is. It stores the product details that are purchased in the ArrayList for easy access later on.

It contains functions like :

Generate bill = for calculating and storing the total amount in a variable Set bill id = for setting the bill id

Display bill = for displaying bill details

addtoDatabase = to add bill details to database table bills.


// optional

StoreConnection.java :
 The store connection is a class file that is used to establish a connection with the files to read and to create a files for “Onlineshop” and five files – login info, admin info, bills, products, and cast info. 

It is imported into the class files like Shop.java and products.java where it is used to access the files and make connections.

IOException: This exception(or related exceptions) to be used wherever BufferedReader has been used.
